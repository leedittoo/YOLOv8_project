We have developed a machine that identifies and collects clean, washed take-out cups to increase recycling rates. 
It can detect the presence of beverages, straws, and cup holders; if absent, a servo motor operates to collect the items and offer a reward. 
The reward system is accessible to everyone through a public IP by opening a server, and user information (ID, PASSWORD, POINT) is also stored. 
This data is accessible to the creator via MySQL.


We use YOLOv8, Colab, Roboflow, FastAPI, Naver Cloud Server, Figma, OpenCV, Aduino, etc..
